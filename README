Introduction:
======================================================
This is a simple tic-tac-toe implementation.
I'll use this project as a starting point for learning
cmake and git.

This is a standard cmake project. Run 

mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make 

to build the project.

======================================================
How to play the game:
======================================================
./game <option> <how_many_times>

<option> can be 1, 2, 3, where
    1 = two players
    2 = player vs cpu
    3 = cpu vs cpu
